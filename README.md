# Match 3 programming assignment

Make a simple Match 3 game based on this Unity project.

The game mechanics are as follows:

  * The game consists of m x n tiles (configurable).

  * If more than three of the same tile type are in a horizontal row, they are removed.

  * A tile falls down if there is no tile below it (unless it's on the bottom row).

  * The user can click on a tile. The tile is then removed.

Make it simple, but write the code to a quality that's good enough for professional developers to continue working on.

Follow Resolution's [Style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/125PpjQRCybOSFyk-ecJC3PgkHHkn5wflN3XIuIVpAV4/edit).

See the movie example.mov to get an idea of what it can look like.
Feel free to make it more spectacular as long as the basic gameplay is there.
